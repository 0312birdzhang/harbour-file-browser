# FAQ for File Browser for Sailfish OS 

### What is File Browser?

File Browser is first-aid tool to access file system without 
enabling developer mode or registering to Yandex and installing
a file manager from there.

### What does error 'Failure to write block' mean?

Your disk (phone or sd card) is most likely full.

### What does error 'Unknown error' mean?

It happens if you try to move a directory from SD Card to phone or
from phone to SD Card. Instead of moving (cut-paste), you should 
copy the directory and then delete it manually.

### Why opening a file does not work, but gives error "No application to open the file"?

It means that the xdg-open command used to open files does not recognize
the file type or it doesn't find a preferred program to open it.

### How can I see how much space is left on storage (on phone or SD Card)?

I don't know.
